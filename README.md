# C Design Patterns

The goal of this repository is to implement several design patterns in the C programming language.
Since C is not Object Oriented, those patterns implementations prove to be in interesting challenge,
but are not necessarily the most useful or beautiful, but they are functionnal, and in their way, reusable,
which was the first and main goal of those patterns to start with.

I put them in distinct directories, but I only implemented the pattern Decorator as of now.

## Decorator

Read the [Pattern Decorator](./Decorator/README.md) file to know more.
